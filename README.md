## Implementation Details

  JavaScript: Used for adding interactivity and managing dynamic content.
  CSS: Custom styles applied to design and layout the webpage.

Key Features
    Responsive Design: The webpage is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.
    Custom Code: All the layouts and styling are crafted using custom code rather than relying on plugins.
    Layout Matching: The recreated webpage closely aligns with the original Hexnode Kiosk Solution webpage in terms of layout and aesthetics.

## Challenges Faced

Although I didn't face any major challenges while designing the page, I did encounter a small challenge while creating the accordion section (Multi-platform Endpoint Management). By using custom code, I was able to complete it and match the original design with the same functionalities.
